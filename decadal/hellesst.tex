\subsection*{The Helles-ST: Repurposing the LSST hardware for\\ a heterogeneous, low-resolution, wide-area survey}

\paragraph{Executive summary:}
foo

\paragraph{Generalities:}
SPHEREx is context.

Tremendous simplicity of LSST is context.

Great improvements in the community abilities to deal with big, complex data.

\paragraph{Information theory:}
As you narrow bands, what do you lose (sensitivity) and what do you gain (information per photon)?

Consider the case of a time-independent object and a time-dependent object separately.

\paragraph{Large-scale structure:}
Grab from SPHEREx

\paragraph{Time-domain astrophysics:}
Probably non-uniform cadence on the sky.
Probably deep drilling fields.
CR-split not at 15+15.

\paragraph{Stellar characterization and abundances:}
Check Ting papers re abundances.

Consult with Faherty about low-mass stars.

\paragraph{Scientific and technical context:}
LSST has already run so we have an amazing image of the sky as a basis for forced photometry and low-SNR objects.

SPHEREx, Gaia, 21-cm, etc. How do these affect design?

Calibration and the complexity of the data.
The point that LSST will already have had to face much of this despite the attempt to be uniform!
